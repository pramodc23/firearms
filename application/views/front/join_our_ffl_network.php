<p>Open your store 24/7 and reach knowledgeable buyers all over the country! Turn used guns into cash in a matter of days to help with cash flow. &nbsp;We consistently attract 7 million unique visitors each month. We have over 4 million registered users. &nbsp;Many sellers report that they sell more merchandise at better profit margins here than anywhere else,&nbsp;including gun shows, classified ads, and other online auctions. Each month millions of dollars worth of&nbsp;items are sold through GunBroker.com. We bring the buyers to you.</p>
<p>Selling online is easier than you think. In a nutshell, you create listings for your&nbsp;items by filling in fields in our online <a href="#">List an&nbsp;Item</a> form. Bidders place bids on your merchandise. When a bidder wins an item, we&nbsp;notify both you and the bidder by email. You then contact the bidder by email and make&nbsp;arrangements for payment and delivery. Typically, the buyer mails you payment and a signed&nbsp;copy of his (or his transfer dealer's) FFL. You then ship the item to the address on the&nbsp;FFL. If the item is not a firearm, the buyer prepays but does not send an FFL; you can&nbsp;ship non-firearm items directly to the buyer. We cover selling and shipping more&nbsp;thoroughly in our <a href="#">Seller section of FAQs</a>.</p>
